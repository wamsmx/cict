# ROMA’s project
The oscillations' monitoring and analytics (ROMA) project is operated jointly by the University of Mexico (UNAM, in Spanish) located in Mexico City, the Michoacan State University (MSU) located in Morelia,  and the Nuevo Leon State University (NLSU) located in Monterrey. ROMA is supported by the Power Information Technology  Laboratory at the University of Tennessee, in special by the FNET/GridEye project.  ROMA is integrated by a time-synchronized wide-area monitoring system (WAMS) based on frequency disturbance recorders  (FDRs) and phasor measurement units (PMUs) that enable to provide real-time information of the power system dynamics,  such as their frequency, phase angle, and voltage which are measured at conventional 120 V outlets. 
All measurements are continuously transmitted via the Internet to the ROMA server hosted at the  Michoacan State University and collected through a real-time collection of phasor measurements  from the low voltage grid into a complex phasor data concentrator (PDC) powered by an open source phasor data concentrator, the OpenPDC administered by the Grid Protection Alliance.

## Research Applications
By harnessing the potential of a realistic WAMS in Mexico, the ROMA’s project specifically targets to enrich research and provide solutions in power system applications concerning PMUs and data analytics. Specifically, such as:

- Wide-area frequency visualization and graphic display.
- Wide-area angle visualization and graphic display.
- Coherency detection by dynamic clustering from wide-area frequency and angle measurements.
- Angle stability situational awareness via spectral analysis, localization of oscillation sources, and detection of low-frequency oscillations and phase angle differences.
- Angle stability indices via real-time inter-area oscillatory mode identification.
- Online data recovery for Multi-channel PMU data processing.
- High-dimensionality PMU data reduction through big data analytics.
